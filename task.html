        <p>Today we head a couple of hours north into the country's highlands. First stop is to view some rice fields - a seemingly endless vista of a spookily bright green, with a backdrop of jungle clad mountains.The road gets progressively steeper and windier as we head north. Next stop are the spectacular Ravana Falls which cascade some twenty five metres over sheer rock faces towering above the road. The Falls might be why everyone stops here but the sideshows provide the real entertainment. There are monkeys scampering around looking for opportunities to pilfer food from unsuspecting tourists. Then there are a bunch of elderly guys trying to sell chunks of crystalline rock, which they're insisting are precious stones. They sure are persistent. One tries to shove a lump into Issy's handbag. Another guy tries to get me to buy some allegedly "ancient" Sinhalese coins, which Samy tells us were probably minted this morning. It seems that trying to climb the Falls might not be all that beneficial to your health - there's a sign telling us that so far 36 people have died in the attempt. Hmmm. <button>Read More</button>
